    "# Text feature selection\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have seen how to process and wrangle text data. All machine learning or deep learning models cannot understand text data directly and they only understand numeric representations of features as inputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's learn how to work with text data, which is definitely one of the most abundant sources of unstructured data. Text data usually consists of documents that can represent words, sentences, or even paragraphs of free-flowing text. The inherent lack of structure and noisy nature of textual data makes it harder for machine learning methods to directly work on raw text data. We start to explore some of the most popular and effective strategies for extracting meaningful features from text data. These features can then be used to represent text efficiently, which can be further leveraged in building machine learning or deep learning models easily to solve complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is very important and is a way to create superior and better performing machine learning models. We are going to cover a wide variety of techniques for feature engineering to represent text data. \n",

    "## Vector space\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a free-flowing text in the form of words, phrases, sentences, and entire documents. Words make phrases, which in turn make sentences, which in turn make paragraphs. However, you can have a wide variety of words that can vary across documents and each sentence will also be of variable length. \n",
    "\n",
    "A `vector space model` is a useful concept when dealing with textual data and is very popular in information retrieval and document ranking. The vector space model is also called the `term vector model` and is defined as a mathematical and algebraic model for transforming and representing text documents as numeric vectors of specific terms, which form the vector dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, consider we have a document `D` in a document vector space `VS`. The number of dimensions or columns for each document will be the total number of distinct terms or words for all documents in the vector space. Hence the vector space `VS` can be denoted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "VS = {$W_1, W_2,  ... , W_n$}\n",
    "\n",
    "where there are `n` distinct words across all documents. Now we can represent document `D` in this vector space `VS` as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "D = {$w_{D_1}, w_{D_2},  ... , w_{D_n}$}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w_{D_n} denotes the weight for word `n` in document `D`. This weight is a numeric value and can be anything ranging from the frequency of that word in the document, the average frequency of occurrence, embedding weights, or even the `TF-IDF` weight, which we discuss shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important point to remember about feature extraction is that when we build a feature engineering model using transformations and mathematical operations, we need to make sure we use the same process when extracting features from new documents to be predicted and not rebuild the whole algorithm again based on the new documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building a Text Corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a text corpus to work on and demonstrate different feature engineering and representation methodologies. Let's build a simple text corpus, i.e. a collection of text documents belonging to one or more subjects or topics.  "

    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing Our Text Corpus\n",
    "There can be multiple ways of cleaning and preprocessing textual data. Let's highlight some of the most important ones that are used heavily in Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines. \n",
    "* **Removing tags**: Our text often contains unnecessary content like HTML tags, which do not add much value when analyzing text. The BeautifulSoup library does an excellent job in providing necessary functions for this.\n",
    "* **Removing accented characters**: In any text corpus, especially if you are dealing with the English language, you might be dealing with accented characters/letters. Hence, you need to make sure that these characters are converted and standardized into ASCII characters. \n",
    "* **Expanding contractions**: In the English language, contractions are basically shortened versions of words or syllables, created by removing specific letters and sounds. Examples include do not to don’t and I would to I’d. Converting each contraction to its expanded, original form often helps with text standardization.\n",
    "* **Removing special characters**: Special characters and symbols that are usually non alphanumeric characters often add to the extra noise in unstructured text. More often than not, simple regular expressions (regexes) can be used to achieve this.\n",
    "* **Stemming**: Word stems are the base form of possible words that can be created by attaching affixes like prefixes and suffixes to the stem to create new words. This is known as `inflection`. The reverse process of obtaining the base form of a word is known as `stemming`. A simple example are the words watches, watching, and watched. They have the word root stem watch as the base form. \n",
    "* **Lemmatization**: It is very similar to stemming, where we remove word affixes to get to the base form of a word. However, the base form in this case is known as the root word but not the root stem. The difference being that the root word is always a lexicographically correct word (present in the dictionary) but the root stem may not always be correct.\n",
    "* **Removing stopwords**: Words that have little or no significance, especially when constructing meaningful features from text, are known as stopwords. These are usually words that end up having the maximum frequency if you do a simple term or word frequency in a corpus. Words like `a`, `an`, `the`, and so on are considered to be stopwords. There is no universal stopword list, but we use a standard English language stopwords list from NLTK. You can also add your own domain specific stopwords as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also do other standard operations like tokenization, removing extra whitespace, text lowercasing and more advanced operations like spelling corrections, grammatical error corrections, removing repeated characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a simple text preprocessor that focuses on removing special characters, extra whitespace, digits, stopwords, and then lower casing the text corpus."

This includes term frequencies, TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), N-grams, and so on. While they are effective methods for extracting features from text, due to the inherent nature of the model being just a bag of unstructured words, we lose additional information like the semantics, structure, sequence, and context around nearby words in each text document. \n",

A vector space model is simply a mathematical model to represent unstructured text (or any other data) as numeric vectors, such that each dimension of the vector is a specific feature/attribute. The Bag of Words model represents each `text document` as a `numeric vector` where each `dimension` is a `specific word` from the corpus and the `value` could be its frequency in the document, occurrence (denoted by 1 or 0), or even weighted values. The model’s name is such because each document is represented literally as a bag of its own words, disregarding word order, sequences, and grammar.\n",

    "### TF-IDF Model\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some potential problems that might arise with the Bag of Words model when it is used on large corpora. Since the feature vectors are based on absolute term frequencies, there might be some terms that occur frequently across all documents and these may tend to overshadow other terms in the feature set. \n",
    "* Especially words that do not occur as frequently, but might be more interesting and effective as features to identify specific categories. \n",
    "This is where TF-IDF is usefil. TF-IDF stands for `term frequency-inverse document frequency`. It is a combination of two metrics, term frequency (`tf`) and inverse document frequency (`idf`). \n",
    "* This technique was originally developed as a metric for ranking search engine results based on user queries and has come to be a part of information retrieval and text feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's formally define TF-IDF now and look at the mathematical representations before diving into its implementation. TD-IDF is the product of two metrics and can be represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`tf-idf = tf x idf`\n",
    "\n",
    "where term frequency (`tf`) and inverse-document frequency (`idf`) represent the two metrics we just talked about. Term frequency, denoted by `tf`, is what we computed in the Bag of Words model. Term \n",
    "frequency in any document vector is denoted by the raw frequency value of that term in a particular document. Mathematically it can be represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`tf(w,D) =` $f_w{_D}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where $f_w{_D}$ denoted frequency for word $w$ in document $D$, which becomes the term frequency ($tf$). Sometimes you can also normalize the absolute raw frequency using logarithms or averaging the frequency. We use the raw frequency in our computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse document frequency denoted by `idf` is the inverse of the document frequency for each term and is computed by dividing the total number of documents in our corpus by the document frequency for each term and then applying logarithmic scaling to the result. \n",
    "* We will be adding 1 to the document frequency for each term to indicate that we also have one more document in our corpus, which essentially has every term in the vocabulary. This is to prevent potential division by zero errors and smoothen the inverse document frequencies. \n",
    "* We also add 1 to the result of our idf computation to avoid ignoring terms that might have zero idf. \n",
    "Mathematically, `idf` can be represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`idf(w,D)=1 + log(N/(1+df(w)))`\n",
    "\n",
    "where `idf(w, D)` represents the `idf` for the term/word `w` in document `D`, `N` represents the total number of documents in our corpus, and `df(w)` represents the number of documents in which the term `w` is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the term frequency-inverse document frequency can be computed by multiplying these two measures. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final TF-IDF metric that we will be using is a normalized version of the `tfidf` matrix that we get from the product of `tf` and `idf`. \n",
    "* We will normalize the `tfidf` matrix by dividing it by the `L2` norm of the matrix, also known as the `Euclidean` norm, which is the square root of the sum of the square of each term’s `tfidf` weight. \n",
    "The final tfidf feature vector is represented as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`tfidf final = tfidf / ∥tfidf∥`\n",
    "\n",
    "where `∥tfidf∥` represents the Euclidean L2 norm for the `tfidf` matrix. "

    "Use `fit_transform(...)` function to build a feature matrix on all documents in your corpus. This typically becomes the training feature set on which you build and train your predictive or other machine learning models. Once ready, leverage the `transform()` function to generate feature vectors of new documents. This can then be fed into your trained models to generate insights as needed.\n",

    "### Document Similarity\n",
    "Document similarity is the process of using a distance or similarity based metric that can identify how similar a text document is to any other document(s) based on features extracted from the documents, like `Bag of Words` or `TF-IDF`. Thus you can see that we can build on top of the TF-IDF-based features and use them to generate new features. Domains such as search engines, document clustering, and information retrieval can be leveraged using these similarity based features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pairwise document similarity in a corpus involves computing document similarity for each pair of documents in a corpus. Thus, if you have `C` documents in a corpus, you would end up with a `C x C` matrix, such that each row and column represents the similarity score for a pair of documents. This represents the indices at the row and column, respectively. There are several similarity and distance metrics that are used to compute document similarity. These include cosine distance/similarity, Euclidean distance, manhattan distance, BM25 similarity, jaccard distance, and so on. In this notebook, we use the most popular and widely used similarity metrics—cosine similarity and compare pairwise document similarity—based on their TF-IDF feature vectors."
